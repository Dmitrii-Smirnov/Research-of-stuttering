Architecture with OOP and Parallel Processing:

1. DataHandler Class (data_handler.py):
    * Methods for reading audio and metadata from the dataset.
    * Parallel processing can be used here to speed up the reading of data from multiple files.
2. Preprocessor Class (preprocessor.py):
    * Methods for audio signal preprocessing, such as noise reduction and normalization.
    * Feature extraction methods that can be parallelized to process multiple audio clips simultaneously.
3. Model Class (model.py):
    * Base class for all models with common methods like fit, predict, and score.
    * Derived classes for each machine learning model you'll use (e.g., SVMModel, DecisionTreeModel).
4. Analyzer Class (analyzer.py):
    * Takes instances of Model classes and applies them to the dataset.
    * Uses parallel processing to apply models to different partitions of the data.
5. ResultsHandler Class (results_handler.py):
    * Methods for saving results, generating visualizations, and exporting reports.
    * Could use parallel processing for generating multiple visualizations at once.
6. MainApp Class (main_app.py):
    * This is the main entry point of the application that uses instances of other classes to load data, preprocess it, analyze it, and handle results.

In this structure:

/data/: Contains raw audio files and metadata.
/preprocessed_data/: Stores data after preprocessing.
/models/: Holds serialized models and model-related classes.
/results/: Directory for saving output like CSV files, and images or HTML files for plots.
/src/: Contains all Python class files for data handling, preprocessing, modeling, analysis, and results handling.
/visualizations/: New directory for storing visualization scripts and output images or interactive plots.
/logs/: Directory for log files.
/utils/: Contains additional utility functions.
The MainApp class in main_app.py would coordinate the flow of the program, managing the execution of different components and ensuring that the final output is produced. It can also handle parallel execution if needed.
