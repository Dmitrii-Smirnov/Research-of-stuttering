Architecture with OOP and Parallel Processing:

1. DataHandler Class (data_handler.py):
    * Methods for reading audio and metadata from the dataset.
    * Parallel processing can be used here to speed up the reading of data from multiple files.
2. Preprocessor Class (preprocessor.py):
    * Methods for audio signal preprocessing, such as noise reduction and normalization.
    * Feature extraction methods that can be parallelized to process multiple audio clips simultaneously.
3. Model Class (model.py):
    * Base class for all models with common methods like fit, predict, and score.
    * Derived classes for each machine learning model you'll use (e.g., SVMModel, DecisionTreeModel).
4. Analyzer Class (analyzer.py):
    * Takes instances of Model classes and applies them to the dataset.
    * Uses parallel processing to apply models to different partitions of the data.
5. ResultsHandler Class (results_handler.py):
    * Methods for saving results, generating visualizations, and exporting reports.
    * Could use parallel processing for generating multiple visualizations at once.
6. MainApp Class (main_app.py):
    * This is the main entry point of the application that uses instances of other classes to load data, preprocess it, analyze it, and handle results.

Folders and Files:

- /data/ - This directory will hold all the raw audio files and metadata.
- /preprocessed_data/ - A dedicated directory for storing intermediate data after preprocessing.
- /models/ - Directory to store serialized models or any model-related data.
- /results/ - Directory for saving output like CSV files, images of plots, etc.
- /src/ - This directory will contain all your Python class files.
    - /src/data_handler.py
    - /src/preprocessor.py
    - /src/models/
        - /src/models/model.py - base model class
        - /src/models/svm_model.py - SVM specific class
        - /src/models/tree_model.py - Decision Tree specific class
    - /src/analyzer.py
    - /src/results_handler.py
    - /src/main_app.py
- /logs/ - Directory for log files.
- /utils/ - Additional utility functions that can be used across classes.

Execution Flow:
The MainApp class would coordinate the flow of the program, ensuring that each component does its part.
It might manage threads or processes for parallel execution and would ensure that all pieces come together
to form the final output.
